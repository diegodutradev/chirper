<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Tuiter is a chirper app inspired by Twitter. You can post short texts of 255 characters and see what other users have previously posted. You can delete and edit your "tuites" (functionality that was missing in the original app). This app was made just to study and develop my skills with Laravel.</p>
